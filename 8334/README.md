1. Make [something to extract sentences from Project Gutenberg during NaNoGenMo 2014](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2014/issues/116).
2. Later, use it to make [@sixworderbot to tweet six-word stories](https://twitter.com/sixworderbot) from six-word sentences found in Project Gutenberg.
3. Decide to make an anthology of @sixworderbot's tweets!
4. Download the [Twitter archive](https://hugovk.github.io/randomsentencebot/).
5. Realise it's only been going long enough for 1,390 stories and 1,390 * 6 is only 8,390 words.
6. Run @sixworderbot locally `int(math.ceil(50000/6.0)) == 8,334` times.
7. Knock up some [MD](https://github.com/hugovk/NaNoGenMo-2015/blob/gh-pages/8334/8334.md), [HTML](https://hugovk.github.io/NaNoGenMo-2015/8334/8334.html) and a [PDF](https://hugovk.github.io/NaNoGenMo-2015/8334/8334.pdf).
