# Eight Thousand, Three Hundred and Thirty-Four Six-Word Stories

1. Make something to extract sentences from Project Gutenberg for NaNoGenMo 2014.
2. Later, use it to make @sixworderbot to tweet six-word stories.
3. Decide to make an anthology of @sixworderbot's tweets!
4. Download the Twitter archive.
5. Realise it's only been going long enough for 1,390 stories and 1,390 * 6 is only 8,390 words.
6. Run @sixworderbot locally `int(math.ceil(50000/6.0)) == 8,334` times.
7. Knock up some MD, HTML and a PDF.
