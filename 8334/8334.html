<h2 id="story2593">Story 2,593</h2>

<p>Well, what are you smiling at?</p>

<h2 id="story2594">Story 2,594</h2>

<h2 id="story2713">Story 2,713</h2>

<h2 id="story2716">Story 2,716</h2>

<p>I sobbed and cried most sadly.</p>

<h2 id="story2717">Story 2,717</h2>

<p>It might be the exertion likewise.</p>

<p>What a blow was there given!</p>

<h2 id="story3805">Story 3,805</h2>

<p>This time Porfiry Kapitonitch actually frowned.</p>

<h2 id="story3806">Story 3,806</h2>

<p>No harm hath come to him.</p>

<p>Hard facts were enough for him.</p>

<h2 id="story3831">Story 3,831</h2>

<p>Culture is half-way to heaven.</p>

<h2 id="story3832">Story 3,832</h2>

<p>Shall we go to see Granny?</p>

<h2 id="story3834">Story 3,834</h2>

<p>Touch her soft mouth, and march.</p>

<h2 id="story3835">Story 3,835</h2>

<p>Does it show in my face?</p>

<h2 id="story3836">Story 3,836</h2>

<p>The Duke was obviously much affected.</p>

<h2 id="story3837">Story 3,837</h2>

<h2 id="story3856">Story 3,856</h2>

<h2 id="story3866">Story 3,866</h2>

<h2 id="story3867">Story 3,867</h2>

<p>My attitude was illogical and absurd.</p>

<h2 id="story3868">Story 3,868</h2>

<p>&#8220;Why have you lured me here?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story3869">Story 3,869</h2>

<p>Proportions, difference of, in distinct races.</p>

<h2 id="story3877">Story 3,877</h2>

<h2 id="story3878">Story 3,878</h2>

<p>I might really ask myself why.</p>

<h2 id="story3879">Story 3,879</h2>

<p>He had chosen his time well.</p>

<h2 id="story3880">Story 3,880</h2>

<p>As applied to Her Royal Highness.</p>

<h2 id="story4649">Story 4,649</h2>

<p>I will, though,&#8211;comrade, I will!</p>

<h2 id="story4650">Story 4,650</h2>

<p>The theme was Love and Death.</p>

<h2 id="story4651">Story 4,651</h2>

<p>And do these arms enfold thee?</p>

<h2 id="story4652">Story 4,652</h2>

<p>And that is your modern world.</p>

<p>replied the young men in chorus.</p>

<h2 id="story4654">Story 4,654</h2>

<p>Whether there, or there, or there?</p>

<h2 id="story4655">Story 4,655</h2>

<p>I thinke you know him: Mr.</p>

<p>shall we speak of the terms?</p>

<h2 id="story4657">Story 4,657</h2>

<p>They were bereft of their food.</p>

<h2 id="story4658">Story 4,658</h2>

<p>Oh, the misery of all bestowers!</p>

<h2 id="story4659">Story 4,659</h2>

<p>Variable light Airs and Clear weather.</p>

<p>I may, however, summarize our position.</p>

<h2 id="story4663">Story 4,663</h2>

<p>His eyes fluttered and went shut.</p>

<h2 id="story4664">Story 4,664</h2>

<p>Napper Tandy was also an Irishman.</p>

<h2 id="story4665">Story 4,665</h2>

<p>It even stimulated him, excited him.</p>

<h2 id="story4666">Story 4,666</h2>

<p>I think it well, my lord.</p>

<h2 id="story4667">Story 4,667</h2>

<p>The lady was of unshaken nerves.</p>

<h2 id="story4668">Story 4,668</h2>

<p>However, it had to be done.</p>

<h2 id="story4669">Story 4,669</h2>

<p>Oh yes, for myself as well.</p>

<h2 id="story4670">Story 4,670</h2>

<p>repeated Mr. Tetlow in some surprise.</p>

<p>i.e., what didst thou see?</p>

<h2 id="story4682">Story 4,682</h2>

<p>She ran off to her father.</p>

<h2 id="story4683">Story 4,683</h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes I do, indeed I do.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4684">Story 4,684</h2>

<p>How do you feel now, dear?</p>

<h2 id="story4685">Story 4,685</h2>

<p>How do I appear to people?</p>

<h2 id="story4687">Story 4,687</h2>

<p>&#8220;Now, Helen, what did happen really?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4688">Story 4,688</h2>

<p>No one knows what Pluffles thought.</p>

<h2 id="story4689">Story 4,689</h2>

<p>The disciplinary courts were very interesting.</p>

<h2 id="story4693">Story 4,693</h2>

<p>Here we sat a while talking.</p>

<h2 id="story4694">Story 4,694</h2>

<p>He also drank from his glass.</p>

<h2 id="story4702">Story 4,702</h2>

<p>that my leg is too long?</p>

<h2 id="story4703">Story 4,703</h2>

<p>The earth gave forth its freshness.</p>

<h2 id="story4704">Story 4,704</h2>

<p>Anne, whatever are you thinking of?</p>

<h2 id="story4705">Story 4,705</h2>

<p>For that I do not weep.</p>

<h2 id="story4706">Story 4,706</h2>

<p>&#8220;Not at all, &#8211; not at all.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4707">Story 4,707</h2>

<p>Suddenly a tremendous explosion was heard.</p>

<h2 id="story4708">Story 4,708</h2>

<h2 id="story4712">Story 4,712</h2>

<p>Charles looked at him and cowered.</p>

<h2 id="story4713">Story 4,713</h2>

<p>&#8217;We have quite enough free-thinking.</p>

<h2 id="story4714">Story 4,714</h2>

<p>Oh, it is raging within me.</p>

<h2 id="story4715">Story 4,715</h2>

<p>Catharine looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<h2 id="story4716">Story 4,716</h2>

<p>&#8220;I will be very, very glad.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4717">Story 4,717</h2>

<p>What is all this racket about?</p>

<h2 id="story4718">Story 4,718</h2>

<p>Thus much for England and France.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you not think so?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4722">Story 4,722</h2>

<p>He has but increased the debt!</p>

<h2 id="story4723">Story 4,723</h2>

<p>But he said never a word.</p>

<h2 id="story4724">Story 4,724</h2>

<p>Indeed he is fair of favour.</p>

<p>Are you in search of him?</p>

<h2 id="story4737">Story 4,737</h2>

<p>Well, this must needs be granted.</p>

<h2 id="story4738">Story 4,738</h2>

<p>Letters from Bevisham had suddenly ceased.</p>

<p>She began to fear Willoughby again.</p>

<h2 id="story4741">Story 4,741</h2>

<p>The design succeeded to his wish.</p>

<h2 id="story4743">Story 4,743</h2>

<p>His transfiguration is at an end.</p>

<h2 id="story4744">Story 4,744</h2>

<p>Why dost thou lash that whore?</p>

<h2 id="story4745">Story 4,745</h2>

<p>They all pricked up their ears.</p>

<h2 id="story4746">Story 4,746</h2>

<p>I leave Chesney Wold to-night.</p>

<h2 id="story4747">Story 4,747</h2>

<p>Ah, the happy ramble that year!</p>

<h2 id="story4761">Story 4,761</h2>

<p>Think them over for a moment.</p>

<h2 id="story4762">Story 4,762</h2>

<p>This story is worth a diversion.</p>

<h2 id="story4763">Story 4,763</h2>

<p>Scott cried desperately at the crowd.</p>

<h2 id="story4764">Story 4,764</h2>

<p>&#8217;It grieves me to think differently.</p>

<h2 id="story4765">Story 4,765</h2>

<p>Sir James looked at him keenly.</p>

<h2 id="story4766">Story 4,766</h2>

<p>I wish to avoid an illness.</p>

<h2 id="story4767">Story 4,767</h2>

<p>Strange love talk, is it not?</p>

<h2 id="story4768">Story 4,768</h2>

<p>Oh, the unworthy, the disgraceful traitor!</p>

<h2 id="story4769">Story 4,769</h2>

<p>But in that I must venture.</p>

<p>&#8220;From her Majesty, as I think.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4771">Story 4,771</h2>

<p>Yes, it would be as well.</p>

<p>&#8220;She said it was high time.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story4775">Story 4,775</h2>

<p>Condemned villaine, I do apprehend thee.</p>

<h2 id="story4776">Story 4,776</h2>

<p>The question had to be repeated.</p>

<h2 id="story4777">Story 4,777</h2>

<p>Will you be that woman, Tessy?</p>

<h2 id="story4778">Story 4,778</h2>

<p>They are certain to do so.</p>

<h2 id="story4779">Story 4,779</h2>

<p>The dinner was laid for four.</p>

<p>she added, in a beseeching tone.</p>

<h2 id="story4784">Story 4,784</h2>

<p>To look; a look at something.</p>

<h2 id="story4807">Story 4,807</h2>

<p>He floated thus for several months.</p>

<h2 id="story4808">Story 4,808</h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, which way is straight ahead?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6392">Story 6,392</h2>

<p>I was on the look-out.</p>

<h2 id="story6393">Story 6,393</h2>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he guessed you were listening.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6394">Story 6,394</h2>

<p>This get I by his death.</p>

<h2 id="story6395">Story 6,395</h2>

<p>&#8220;Because part of it was watermelon.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6396">Story 6,396</h2>

<p>I will never dare say it!</p>

<h2 id="story6397">Story 6,397</h2>

<p>Fouche is too cunning for you!</p>

<h2 id="story6401">Story 6,401</h2>

<h2 id="story6402">Story 6,402</h2>

<p>He hath wronged me, Master Page.</p>

<h2 id="story6403">Story 6,403</h2>

<p>Anne herself answered, lifting her head.</p>

<h2 id="story6404">Story 6,404</h2>

<p>Porthos nodded in sign of agreement.</p>

<h2 id="story6405">Story 6,405</h2>

<p>Who set those houses on fire?</p>

<h2 id="story6408">Story 6,408</h2>

<p>Merely the correction of an error.</p>

<h2 id="story6409">Story 6,409</h2>

<p>Nay, then, he is a conjurer.</p>

<h2 id="story6410">Story 6,410</h2>

<p>Behold that other against Naples wend!</p>

<h2 id="story6411">Story 6,411</h2>

<p>&#8217;Queer sight to see in England.</p>

<h2 id="story6412">Story 6,412</h2>

<p>Oh vero sfavillar del Santo Spiro!</p>

<h2 id="story6413">Story 6,413</h2>

<p>And he is full of laughter.</p>

<h2 id="story6414">Story 6,414</h2>

<h2 id="story6418">Story 6,418</h2>

<p>They presently stopped and turned around.</p>

<h2 id="story6419">Story 6,419</h2>

<p>The universe is what it is.</p>

<h2 id="story6420">Story 6,420</h2>

<p>The gloom deepened around Jean Valjean.</p>

<h2 id="story6421">Story 6,421</h2>

<p>Why, whativer is the matter, sister?</p>

<h2 id="story6422">Story 6,422</h2>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about it myself.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6423">Story 6,423</h2>

<p>&#8220;Why did not you all learn?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6424">Story 6,424</h2>

<p>I dismissed my maid at Chester.</p>

<h2 id="story6425">Story 6,425</h2>

<p>All is well, that Ends well.</p>

<h2 id="story6426">Story 6,426</h2>

<h2 id="story6429">Story 6,429</h2>

<p>All this was effected by religion.</p>

<h2 id="story6430">Story 6,430</h2>

<p>Will they not be happier now?</p>

<h2 id="story6431">Story 6,431</h2>

<p>Compare Milton, P. L. b. xii.</p>

<h2 id="story6432">Story 6,432</h2>

<p>She stole a glance at him.</p>

<h2 id="story6433">Story 6,433</h2>

<p>&#8230; Will it be just the same?</p>

<p>`There, what did I tell you?</p>

<h2 id="story6439">Story 6,439</h2>

<p>How can you be so cruel!</p>

<h2 id="story6440">Story 6,440</h2>

<p>&#8220;Neither of us has a regret.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6441">Story 6,441</h2>

<p>said Gudrun, with heavy hateful irony.</p>

<h2 id="story6442">Story 6,442</h2>

<p>Ay, the deuce, then look outside!</p>

<h2 id="story6443">Story 6,443</h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes, madam, he has been here.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6446">Story 6,446</h2>

<p>Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?</p>

<h2 id="story6447">Story 6,447</h2>

<p>Does this seem a fair description?</p>

<h2 id="story6448">Story 6,448</h2>

<p>LORD RIVERS, brother to Lady Grey.</p>

<p>Che importava loro del decoro nazionale?</p>

<h2 id="story6451">Story 6,451</h2>

<p>But I tried it last night.</p>

<h2 id="story6452">Story 6,452</h2>

<p>I am always knocking my head.</p>

<h2 id="story6453">Story 6,453</h2>

<p>&#8220;You do not like it, then?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6454">Story 6,454</h2>

<p>Do you believe in the Parcae?</p>

<h2 id="story6455">Story 6,455</h2>

<p>&#8220;I am resolved on extreme measures.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6456">Story 6,456</h2>

<p>&#8220;But the Arabs will overtake him!&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6457">Story 6,457</h2>

<p>Let us go to his rescue.</p>

<h2 id="story6458">Story 6,458</h2>

<p>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>

<h2 id="story6459">Story 6,459</h2>

<p>que dites-vous de ce trait?</p>

<h2 id="story6460">Story 6,460</h2>

<p>He will get some coquettish rigmarole.</p>

<h2 id="story6461">Story 6,461</h2>

<p>Thy humour is the more dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="story6462">Story 6,462</h2>

<p>What do you think will happen?</p>

<h2 id="story6463">Story 6,463</h2>

<p>Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor.</p>

<h2 id="story6464">Story 6,464</h2>

<p>Now all is clear between us.</p>

<h2 id="story6465">Story 6,465</h2>

<p>said Fellingham, jumping to his feet.</p>

<h2 id="story6466">Story 6,466</h2>

<p>Is it something to be distrusted?</p>

<h2 id="story6467">Story 6,467</h2>

<p>EXHIBITION, allowance for keep, pocket-money.</p>

<h2 id="story6468">Story 6,468</h2>

<p>Gania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing.</p>

<h2 id="story6469">Story 6,469</h2>

<p>Empty your bucket over the side.</p>

<h2 id="story6470">Story 6,470</h2>

<p>It was not so at all!</p>

<h2 id="story6471">Story 6,471</h2>

<p>Twenty times we were near capsizing.</p>

<h2 id="story6472">Story 6,472</h2>

<p>That is an abuse of language.</p>

<h2 id="story6473">Story 6,473</h2>

<p>If not now, a little later.</p>

<h2 id="story6474">Story 6,474</h2>

<p>But most of them believe not.</p>

<h2 id="story6475">Story 6,475</h2>

<p>&#8220;Your Sundays will be your own.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6476">Story 6,476</h2>

<p>How came you in my palace?</p>

<h2 id="story6477">Story 6,477</h2>

<p>Is he not an abominable man?</p>

<h2 id="story6478">Story 6,478</h2>

<p>This man, Lucas, furnished a duplicate.</p>

<h2 id="story6479">Story 6,479</h2>

<p>he cried in a loud voice.</p>

<h2 id="story6480">Story 6,480</h2>

<p>I think I would do so.</p>

<h2 id="story6481">Story 6,481</h2>

<p>You may restrain him from excesses.</p>

<h2 id="story6482">Story 6,482</h2>

<p>&#8220;That every morning for three weeks.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6483">Story 6,483</h2>

<p>M. Verdurin could not help laughing.</p>

<h2 id="story6484">Story 6,484</h2>

<p>I would notice that: from remembering.</p>

<h2 id="story6485">Story 6,485</h2>

<p>&#8217;Not often: we lose our tempers.</p>

<h2 id="story6486">Story 6,486</h2>

<p>I do not buy and sell.</p>

<h2 id="story6487">Story 6,487</h2>

<p>This will I show the general.</p>

<h2 id="story6488">Story 6,488</h2>

<p>I say, Rosa, not a word!</p>

<h2 id="story6489">Story 6,489</h2>

<p>The Pfalzgraf pleaded a susceptible nostril.</p>

<h2 id="story6490">Story 6,490</h2>

<p>Whither should I flee from myself?</p>

<h2 id="story6491">Story 6,491</h2>

<p>&#8220;Two axes and a pole-axe.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6492">Story 6,492</h2>

<p>&#8211;What did you buy that for?</p>

<h2 id="story6493">Story 6,493</h2>

<p>God was needed for the atonement.</p>

<h2 id="story6494">Story 6,494</h2>

<p>Would ye know the true Farina?</p>

<h2 id="story6495">Story 6,495</h2>

<p>&#8220;Because I was on the jury.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6496">Story 6,496</h2>

<p>(Alle Lords nebst Gefolge gehn ab.</p>

<h2 id="story6498">Story 6,498</h2>

<p>There was indeed cause for alarm.</p>

<h2 id="story6499">Story 6,499</h2>

<p>I held my tongue after that.</p>

<h2 id="story6500">Story 6,500</h2>

<p>To one so sensitive as Victor!</p>

<h2 id="story6501">Story 6,501</h2>

<p>Tell him that I will not.</p>

<h2 id="story6502">Story 6,502</h2>

<p>said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him.</p>

<h2 id="story6503">Story 6,503</h2>

<p>&#8220;Here he is, brother William John.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6504">Story 6,504</h2>

<p>Still the gods sat and smiled.</p>

<h2 id="story6505">Story 6,505</h2>

<p>They took to chanting in alternation.</p>

<h2 id="story6506">Story 6,506</h2>

<p>This was far from upright conduct.</p>

<h2 id="story6507">Story 6,507</h2>

<p>HUM, beer and spirits mixed together.</p>

<h2 id="story6508">Story 6,508</h2>

<p>&#8220;Where does that wedding come from?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6509">Story 6,509</h2>

<p>You&#8211;you&#8211;have&#8211;burned&#8211;your umbrella!</p>

<h2 id="story6510">Story 6,510</h2>

<p>The foreman read the first question.</p>

<h2 id="story6513">Story 6,513</h2>

<p>&#8220;You will thank me &#8211; for what?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6514">Story 6,514</h2>

<p>Full well my tears attest, etc.</p>

<h2 id="story6515">Story 6,515</h2>

<p>We will soon change their opinion.</p>

<h2 id="story6516">Story 6,516</h2>

<p>His wife began to get angry.</p>

<h2 id="story6517">Story 6,517</h2>

<p>And no green thing was seen.</p>

<h2 id="story6518">Story 6,518</h2>

<p>Astolpho was the first to move.</p>

<h2 id="story6529">Story 6,529</h2>

<p>My memory is unto everlasting generations.</p>

<h2 id="story6530">Story 6,530</h2>

<p>Enough, I said, of these civilities.</p>

<h2 id="story6531">Story 6,531</h2>

<p>&#8217;Well, what does she want now?</p>

<h2 id="story6532">Story 6,532</h2>

<p>Then, as the poem has it,&#8211; &quot;.</p>

<h2 id="story6533">Story 6,533</h2>

<p>The tide had begun to ebb.</p>

<h2 id="story6534">Story 6,534</h2>

<h2 id="story6542">Story 6,542</h2>

<p>Ah, your poor Jane, left desolate!</p>

<h2 id="story6543">Story 6,543</h2>

<p>There was no outburst of joy.</p>

<h2 id="story6544">Story 6,544</h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but this is very singular.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story6545">Story 6,545</h2>

<h2 id="story6558">Story 6,558</h2>

<p>&#8217;I believe that he has not.</p>

<h2 id="story7491">Story 7,491</h2>

<p>He shot out a pointing finger.</p>

<h2 id="story7492">Story 7,492</h2>

<p>I can hold it no longer.</p>

<h2 id="story7493">Story 7,493</h2>

<p>-or Baal-Peor?&#8212;or Baal-Zebub?</p>

<h2 id="story7520">Story 7,520</h2>

<p>We have, thank goodness, these harmonies.</p>

<p>I could look on no longer.</p>

<h2 id="story7524">Story 7,524</h2>

<p>We got out of that neatly.</p>

<h2 id="story7533">Story 7,533</h2>

<p>Mr Birkin, he is a changer.</p>

<h2 id="story7534">Story 7,534</h2>

<p>But I am on my guard.</p>

<p>At dawn the hunters were off.</p>

<h2 id="story7536">Story 7,536</h2>

<p>&#8220;How can you think of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, then&#8211;a fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was so glad of that.</p>

<p>Is this wind westerly that blows?</p>

<p>Glad to hear that, old man.</p>

<p>Four men and a boy, sir.</p>

<h2 id="story7555">Story 7,555</h2>

<p>&#8217;What makes you think that, sir?</p>

<h2 id="story7556">Story 7,556</h2>

<p>Did I do so very bad?</p>

<h2 id="story7557">Story 7,557</h2>

<p>There was no disputing the point.</p>

<h2 id="story7558">Story 7,558</h2>

<p>Now lay the table for breakfast.</p>

<h2 id="story7559">Story 7,559</h2>

<p>I would rather not just now.</p>

<p>Yea, they are a contentious people.</p>

<h2 id="story7566">Story 7,566</h2>

<p>She went one way; he another.</p>

<p>Whatever the reason, Russell seemed immovable.</p>

<h2 id="story7570">Story 7,570</h2>

<p>Then he made the military salute.</p>

<h2 id="story7571">Story 7,571</h2>

<p>The exclamation had the desired effect.</p>

<h2 id="story7572">Story 7,572</h2>

<p>The scare-crow scares no longer.</p>

<h2 id="story7573">Story 7,573</h2>

<p>This may lead to miserable things.</p>

<p>What is the main business here?</p>

<h2 id="story7584">Story 7,584</h2>

<p>For the rhyme, see on i.</p>

<h2 id="story7585">Story 7,585</h2>

<p>&#8217;If it doubles the energies, mind.</p>

<h2 id="story7588">Story 7,588</h2>

<p>Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?</p>

<h2 id="story7589">Story 7,589</h2>

<p>&#8220;That you know a person thoroughly.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7590">Story 7,590</h2>

<p>But where were then our heroes?</p>

<h2 id="story7591">Story 7,591</h2>

<p>It was in this way, sir.</p>

<h2 id="story7598">Story 7,598</h2>

<h2 id="story7603">Story 7,603</h2>

<p>He camped with us that night.</p>

<h2 id="story7604">Story 7,604</h2>

<p>This theory we have already considered.</p>

<h2 id="story7605">Story 7,605</h2>

<h2 id="story7608">Story 7,608</h2>

<h2 id="story7609">Story 7,609</h2>

<p>They looked, thunderstruck, at each other.</p>

<h2 id="story7610">Story 7,610</h2>

<p>&#8220;I came to find a friend.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7611">Story 7,611</h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, now for M. Fouquet.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7612">Story 7,612</h2>

<p>&#8220;And you ate in your carriage?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7613">Story 7,613</h2>

<p>She stooped to pick it up.</p>

<h2 id="story7614">Story 7,614</h2>

<p>We loathed everything connected with it.</p>

<p>&#8220;But if I should be wrong?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7635">Story 7,635</h2>

<p>I WAS lonely; I WAS afraid.</p>

<h2 id="story7646">Story 7,646</h2>

<p>Do you mean what you say?</p>

<h2 id="story7647">Story 7,647</h2>

<h2 id="story7661">Story 7,661</h2>

<p>After that he fell dead silent.</p>

<h2 id="story7665">Story 7,665</h2>

<p>Becky almost laughed at her simplicity.</p>

<h2 id="story7666">Story 7,666</h2>

<p>Our visitor sprang from his char.</p>

<h2 id="story7693">Story 7,693</h2>

<p>Smith was breathing hard beside me.</p>

<h2 id="story7694">Story 7,694</h2>

<p>He upholds thee in his hand.</p>

<h2 id="story7695">Story 7,695</h2>

<p>She attributed his emotion to gratitude.</p>

<p>Within the Dun there was disorder.</p>

<h2 id="story7702">Story 7,702</h2>

<p>&#8220;And what may your address be?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7703">Story 7,703</h2>

<p>&#8217;And so it WAS very nice.</p>

<h2 id="story7704">Story 7,704</h2>

<p>Half-past one, time for dinner!</p>

<h2 id="story7705">Story 7,705</h2>

<p>&#8220;Do you regret her, my father?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7739">Story 7,739</h2>

<h2 id="story7740">Story 7,740</h2>

<p>These responsibilities go hand in hand.</p>

<p>He heard familiar voices and rubbered.</p>

<h2 id="story7742">Story 7,742</h2>

<p>How has all that been done?</p>

<h2 id="story7756">Story 7,756</h2>

<p>Enter TECHELLES, THERIDAMAS, USUMCASANE, and others.</p>

<h2 id="story7757">Story 7,757</h2>

<p>&#8220;Purgatory dost thou call it, Sancho?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7758">Story 7,758</h2>

<p>All hope is not then lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know so many men already.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7762">Story 7,762</h2>

<p>he shouted, pushing to the front.</p>

<h2 id="story7763">Story 7,763</h2>

<p>These hold good as to profile.</p>

<h2 id="story7764">Story 7,764</h2>

<h2 id="story7768">Story 7,768</h2>

<p>My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.</p>

<h2 id="story7769">Story 7,769</h2>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter at home?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7770">Story 7,770</h2>

<p>Is that what you would say?</p>

<h2 id="story7771">Story 7,771</h2>

<p>The dog Houdain licked the cup.</p>

<h2 id="story7772">Story 7,772</h2>

<p>This secret is worth massive gold.</p>

<p>Herodotus perhaps confused Coptos with Chemmis.</p>

<h2 id="story7774">Story 7,774</h2>

<p>Indeed I hope so, Sir Joseph.</p>

<h2 id="story7777">Story 7,777</h2>

<p>All in if he spots me.</p>

<h2 id="story7778">Story 7,778</h2>

<p>Take, for example, the Safed Koh.</p>

<h2 id="story7779">Story 7,779</h2>

<p>We are blessed in the change.</p>

<h2 id="story7780">Story 7,780</h2>

<p>She sank back into the chair.</p>

<h2 id="story7781">Story 7,781</h2>

<p>The chateau, and all the race?</p>

<p>Sancho recalled him from his reverie.</p>

<h2 id="story7786">Story 7,786</h2>

<p>How do you mean for nothing?</p>

<h2 id="story7794">Story 7,794</h2>

<p>We will all mourn for him.</p>

<h2 id="story7795">Story 7,795</h2>

<p>But things did not end here.</p>

<h2 id="story7796">Story 7,796</h2>

<p>The foul fiend bites my back.</p>

<h2 id="story7797">Story 7,797</h2>

<p>&#8220;Is that meant for my son?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7798">Story 7,798</h2>

<p>Old friendship demanded it of him.</p>

<h2 id="story7799">Story 7,799</h2>

<p>it is a very simple matter.</p>

<h2 id="story7800">Story 7,800</h2>

<p>&#8220;I-n-d-e-e-d-!&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7805">Story 7,805</h2>

<p>But she mused over it still.</p>

<h2 id="story7806">Story 7,806</h2>

<p>She had neither eaten nor slept.</p>

<h2 id="story7807">Story 7,807</h2>

<p>cried Kit, in a choking voice.</p>

<h2 id="story7808">Story 7,808</h2>

<p>You can hear the pump working.</p>

<h2 id="story7809">Story 7,809</h2>

<h2 id="story7813">Story 7,813</h2>

<p>Mary flew into a fine passion.</p>

<h2 id="story7814">Story 7,814</h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, what are you saying?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7815">Story 7,815</h2>

<p>Wilt thou come out of Jordan?</p>

<h2 id="story7816">Story 7,816</h2>

<p>&#8220;I will find the means myself.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7817">Story 7,817</h2>

<p>Most musical of mourners, weep anew!</p>

<h2 id="story7818">Story 7,818</h2>

<p>You spoke not with her since?</p>

<h2 id="story7819">Story 7,819</h2>

<p>He took me in his arms.</p>

<h2 id="story7820">Story 7,820</h2>

<p>&#8220;We shall not even get halfway.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7821">Story 7,821</h2>

<p>&#8217;Well, yes; he does, at times.</p>

<h2 id="story7822">Story 7,822</h2>

<p>But we like wit&#8211;practical again!</p>

<h2 id="story7823">Story 7,823</h2>

<h2 id="story7824">Story 7,824</h2>

<p>&#8220;I can conceive of no explanation.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7825">Story 7,825</h2>

<p>I will ask him, of course.</p>

<h2 id="story7826">Story 7,826</h2>

<p>What do you call having money?</p>

<h2 id="story7827">Story 7,827</h2>

<p>The most guilty should be heard.</p>

<h2 id="story7828">Story 7,828</h2>

<p>How knew she it so soon?</p>

<h2 id="story7829">Story 7,829</h2>

<p>Richardson was working as a compositor.</p>

<h2 id="story7830">Story 7,830</h2>

<p>You have not heard of Yaada?</p>

<h2 id="story7831">Story 7,831</h2>

<p>She did not answer at once.</p>

<h2 id="story7832">Story 7,832</h2>

<p>&#8220;Why doth the minister sit yonder?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7833">Story 7,833</h2>

<p>I have been in the jug.</p>

<h2 id="story7834">Story 7,834</h2>

<p>Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.</p>

<h2 id="story7835">Story 7,835</h2>

<p>exclaimed the young hunter, straightening up.</p>

<h2 id="story7836">Story 7,836</h2>

<p>Go straight back to London, instantly.</p>

<h2 id="story7837">Story 7,837</h2>

<p>But she pushed him gently back.</p>

<h2 id="story7838">Story 7,838</h2>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, he was all honey, monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7839">Story 7,839</h2>

<p>&#8220;It was I who opened it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7840">Story 7,840</h2>

<p>So little did he understand men!</p>

<h2 id="story7841">Story 7,841</h2>

<p>St. Francis went about doing good.</p>

<h2 id="story7842">Story 7,842</h2>

<p>Philip kissed her wrinkled, thin cheek.</p>

<h2 id="story7843">Story 7,843</h2>

<p>And Charlie did all these things.</p>

<h2 id="story7844">Story 7,844</h2>

<p>I am no impostor, noble lady.</p>

<h2 id="story7845">Story 7,845</h2>

<p>Pray tell me how it happened?</p>

<h2 id="story7846">Story 7,846</h2>

<p>What dost thou in the wilds?</p>

<h2 id="story7847">Story 7,847</h2>

<p>O that I served that lady!</p>

<h2 id="story7848">Story 7,848</h2>

<p>We all sit up and listen.</p>

<h2 id="story7849">Story 7,849</h2>

<p>I think we have some interest.</p>

<h2 id="story7850">Story 7,850</h2>

<p>The two best out of three.</p>

<h2 id="story7851">Story 7,851</h2>

<p>And her mother, no doubt, alas!</p>

<h2 id="story7852">Story 7,852</h2>

<p>That is, the heather for it.</p>

<h2 id="story7853">Story 7,853</h2>

<p>The ventriloquist, however, finished his grin.</p>

<h2 id="story7854">Story 7,854</h2>

<p>They would not be beaten back.</p>

<h2 id="story7855">Story 7,855</h2>

<p>What are you looking at there?</p>

<h2 id="story7856">Story 7,856</h2>

<p>A lonely part of the Forest.</p>

<h2 id="story7857">Story 7,857</h2>

<p>At that moment he hated her.</p>

<h2 id="story7858">Story 7,858</h2>

<p>&#8220;Did you not hear the bell?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7859">Story 7,859</h2>

<p>What was their sole remaining chance?</p>

<h2 id="story7860">Story 7,860</h2>

<p>BED.&#8211;But you are very ill.</p>

<h2 id="story7861">Story 7,861</h2>

<p>The next few minutes were delicious.</p>

<h2 id="story7862">Story 7,862</h2>

<p>&#8220;He will not refuse your help.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7863">Story 7,863</h2>

<p>He was trembling in every part.</p>

<h2 id="story7864">Story 7,864</h2>

<h2 id="story7865">Story 7,865</h2>

<h2 id="story7867">Story 7,867</h2>

<h2 id="story7905">Story 7,905</h2>

<p>And, by Jove, he was right!</p>

<h2 id="story7906">Story 7,906</h2>

<p>Peter listened, but did not stir.</p>

<h2 id="story7907">Story 7,907</h2>

<p>Fugitives of every sort know this.</p>

<p>WALDEGRAVE, Lord, Governor to George III.</p>

<h2 id="story7910">Story 7,910</h2>

<p>We do not beseech, we demand!</p>

<h2 id="story7911">Story 7,911</h2>

<p>Caprice, common to man and animals.</p>

<h2 id="story7912">Story 7,912</h2>

<p>&#8220;Are you certain of it, sir?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7913">Story 7,913</h2>

<p>You might have poisoned us all.</p>

<h2 id="story7914">Story 7,914</h2>

<p>What shall I gain by it?</p>

<h2 id="story7915">Story 7,915</h2>

<p>THE FALSE LAUREL AND THE TRUE.</p>

<h2 id="story7916">Story 7,916</h2>

<p>Life is like a running stream.</p>

<h2 id="story7918">Story 7,918</h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh, some few weeks, I think.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7919">Story 7,919</h2>

<p>Come back to Casterbridge at once!</p>

<h2 id="story7920">Story 7,920</h2>

<p>&#8220;I hope you care to live?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7921">Story 7,921</h2>

<p>His face flickered with bored irritation.</p>

<h2 id="story7924">Story 7,924</h2>

<p>What could be underneath the tent?</p>

<h2 id="story7925">Story 7,925</h2>

<p>See the Theodosian Code, l. xvi.</p>

<h2 id="story7926">Story 7,926</h2>

<p>The disciplinary courts were very interesting.</p>

<h2 id="story7927">Story 7,927</h2>

<p>You hit, you poor old fellow!</p>

<h2 id="story7928">Story 7,928</h2>

<p>Why, what makes you ask that?</p>

<h2 id="story7929">Story 7,929</h2>

<p>I hope you are very well.</p>

<h2 id="story7930">Story 7,930</h2>

<p>But that fellow DOES puzzle me.</p>

<h2 id="story7931">Story 7,931</h2>

<p>She was youth, elegance, freshness itself!</p>

<h2 id="story7932">Story 7,932</h2>

<p>If you pardon, we will mend.</p>

<h2 id="story7933">Story 7,933</h2>

<p>The Carystian - pale, with iron veins.</p>

<h2 id="story7936">Story 7,936</h2>

<p>Which room shall we do first?</p>

<h2 id="story7937">Story 7,937</h2>

<p>And yet see how they look.</p>

<h2 id="story7938">Story 7,938</h2>

<p>Why, is porridge so hurtful, signior?</p>

<h2 id="story7939">Story 7,939</h2>

<p>Tiny, her tremulous fernfoils of maidenhair.</p>

<h2 id="story7940">Story 7,940</h2>

<p>But he did not see it.</p>

<h2 id="story7941">Story 7,941</h2>

<p>You CAN get rid of me.</p>

<h2 id="story7942">Story 7,942</h2>

<p>&#8217;Oh what a woman that is!</p>

<h2 id="story7943">Story 7,943</h2>

<p>&#8211; &#8217;I am not sure of that.</p>

<h2 id="story7944">Story 7,944</h2>

<p>I mean that I understand him.</p>

<h2 id="story7945">Story 7,945</h2>

<p>&#8217;He asks for nothing from you.</p>

<h2 id="story7946">Story 7,946</h2>

<p>I turned up the time-table.</p>

<h2 id="story7947">Story 7,947</h2>

<p>It came from beneath my feet.</p>

<h2 id="story7948">Story 7,948</h2>

<p>Thou art not pleasing unto me.</p>

<h2 id="story7949">Story 7,949</h2>

<p>Nevertheless, his mother loved his sisters.</p>

<h2 id="story7950">Story 7,950</h2>

<p>I adopted her, to be loved.</p>

<h2 id="story7951">Story 7,951</h2>

<p>And where will you go, Augusta?</p>

<h2 id="story7952">Story 7,952</h2>

<p>Everything seemed possible to me then.</p>

<h2 id="story7953">Story 7,953</h2>

<p>said he, looking at me keenly.</p>

<h2 id="story7954">Story 7,954</h2>

<p>But spare me, my dearest girl!</p>

<h2 id="story7955">Story 7,955</h2>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, guardian, I know it.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7956">Story 7,956</h2>

<p>It has all been a mistake.</p>

<h2 id="story7957">Story 7,957</h2>

<p>The first witness was the Hatter.</p>

<h2 id="story7958">Story 7,958</h2>

<p>And certainly Alexander did his best.</p>

<p>A fortnight hold we this solemnity.</p>

<h2 id="story7961">Story 7,961</h2>

<p>Did you still hear the knocking?</p>

<h2 id="story7962">Story 7,962</h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a knife, a sharp blade.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7963">Story 7,963</h2>

<p>Why this is freely doone, Hieronimo.</p>

<h2 id="story7964">Story 7,964</h2>

<p>inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss.</p>

<h2 id="story7965">Story 7,965</h2>

<p>Tell them me, I pray you.</p>

<h2 id="story7966">Story 7,966</h2>

<p>Had the hour of adversity come?</p>

<h2 id="story7967">Story 7,967</h2>

<p>said my uncle Toby&#8211;Where&#8211;Who?</p>

<h2 id="story7968">Story 7,968</h2>

<p>I like the sentiment of it.</p>

<h2 id="story7969">Story 7,969</h2>

<p>&#8220;I knew that man on earth.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7970">Story 7,970</h2>

<p>&#8220;No, I have a wicked heart.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7971">Story 7,971</h2>

<p>It happened according to her wish.</p>

<h2 id="story7972">Story 7,972</h2>

<p>Tacitus thinks with all his might.</p>

<h2 id="story7973">Story 7,973</h2>

<p>Who feeds with a good name?</p>

<h2 id="story7974">Story 7,974</h2>

<p>She is not a child, Merthyr.</p>

<h2 id="story7975">Story 7,975</h2>

<p>Mr Moffat has turned up again.</p>

<h2 id="story7976">Story 7,976</h2>

<p>In Shropshire the custom is similar.</p>

<h2 id="story7977">Story 7,977</h2>

<p>It came from beneath my feet.</p>

<h2 id="story7978">Story 7,978</h2>

<p>Gone in four-and-twenty hours!</p>

<h2 id="story7979">Story 7,979</h2>

<p>when shall I see you again?</p>

<h2 id="story7980">Story 7,980</h2>

<p>&#8220;To whom does this island belong?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7981">Story 7,981</h2>

<p>Even the wallpaper seemed moderately attractive.</p>

<h2 id="story7982">Story 7,982</h2>

<p>We made for the bold Mounseer.</p>

<h2 id="story7983">Story 7,983</h2>

<p>We starved for a while instead.</p>

<h2 id="story7984">Story 7,984</h2>

<p>A cold sweat came over me.</p>

<h2 id="story7985">Story 7,985</h2>

<p>Then she turned to the window.</p>

<h2 id="story7986">Story 7,986</h2>

<p>Gratitude from the House of Austria!</p>

<h2 id="story7987">Story 7,987</h2>

<p>&#8220;What did you run for, fellow?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7988">Story 7,988</h2>

<p>[Enter Talbot and John his son.</p>

<h2 id="story7989">Story 7,989</h2>

<p>Quaeso ne ista superstitione te alliges .</p>

<h2 id="story7990">Story 7,990</h2>

<p>What an extraordinary man you are!</p>

<h2 id="story7991">Story 7,991</h2>

<p>The two teeth had been extracted.</p>

<h2 id="story7992">Story 7,992</h2>

<p>Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon.</p>

<h2 id="story7993">Story 7,993</h2>

<p>&#8220;Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story7994">Story 7,994</h2>

<p>The Second part of King Hen.</p>

<h2 id="story7995">Story 7,995</h2>

<p>He repaired to her chamber, straight.</p>

<h2 id="story7996">Story 7,996</h2>

<p>Owen Gwynedd was probably the greatest.</p>

<h2 id="story7997">Story 7,997</h2>

<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

<h2 id="story7998">Story 7,998</h2>

<p>Joe did not open his lips.</p>

<h2 id="story7999">Story 7,999</h2>

<p>I am afraid of Monsieur Javert.</p>

<h2 id="story8000">Story 8,000</h2>

<p>She turned her face to him.</p>

<h2 id="story8001">Story 8,001</h2>

<p>&#8217;She has no passion for play?</p>

<h2 id="story8002">Story 8,002</h2>

<p>Who said I would not go?</p>

<h2 id="story8003">Story 8,003</h2>

<p>I will take thee with me.</p>

<h2 id="story8004">Story 8,004</h2>

<p>With that he went on reading.</p>

<h2 id="story8005">Story 8,005</h2>

<p>said Lucy, in a broken voice.</p>

<h2 id="story8006">Story 8,006</h2>

<p>&#8220;Go on, to your cousin, then!&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8007">Story 8,007</h2>

<p>Now strike up your music, fellow!</p>

<h2 id="story8008">Story 8,008</h2>

<p>This started him pacing the floor.</p>

<h2 id="story8009">Story 8,009</h2>

<p>I could never have thought it.</p>

<h2 id="story8010">Story 8,010</h2>

<p>&#8220;She will go to the country.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8011">Story 8,011</h2>

<p>They were made for their Eden.</p>

<h2 id="story8012">Story 8,012</h2>

<p>.And yet my portmanteau was empty.</p>

<h2 id="story8013">Story 8,013</h2>

<p>I must remind you of one.</p>

<h2 id="story8014">Story 8,014</h2>

<p>Now, defend me against my husband.</p>

<h2 id="story8015">Story 8,015</h2>

<p>&#8220;What suspicion attaches to Evgenie Pavlovitch?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8016">Story 8,016</h2>

<p>Then it is an air-gun.</p>

<h2 id="story8017">Story 8,017</h2>

<p>What COULD ye know of virtue!</p>

<h2 id="story8018">Story 8,018</h2>

<p>I thank you all the same.</p>

<h2 id="story8019">Story 8,019</h2>

<p>Dissatisfaction with them is wholly justified.</p>

<h2 id="story8020">Story 8,020</h2>

<p>This son is named Andrea Cavalcanti.</p>

<h2 id="story8021">Story 8,021</h2>

<p>And bread was set before him.</p>

<h2 id="story8022">Story 8,022</h2>

<p>We stopped at Caudebec for breakfast.</p>

<h2 id="story8023">Story 8,023</h2>

<p>The voice of one, saying: Cry.</p>

<h2 id="story8024">Story 8,024</h2>

<p>THAT is all to be forgot.</p>

<h2 id="story8025">Story 8,025</h2>

<p>Are you both of ye asleep?</p>

<h2 id="story8026">Story 8,026</h2>

<p>Criticism: Sainte-Beuve, Taine, and others.</p>

<h2 id="story8027">Story 8,027</h2>

<p>We must not underrate the enemy.</p>

<h2 id="story8028">Story 8,028</h2>

<p>&#8220;And was it a fine baby?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8029">Story 8,029</h2>

<p>&#8217;Yes, dear, it is still dark.</p>

<h2 id="story8030">Story 8,030</h2>

<p>But they became also pilgrim feasts.</p>

<h2 id="story8031">Story 8,031</h2>

<p>I was exploring this ruin alone.</p>

<h2 id="story8032">Story 8,032</h2>

<p>Surely all this cannot be accident!</p>

<h2 id="story8033">Story 8,033</h2>

<p>With Bradamant Rogero wends his way.</p>

<h2 id="story8034">Story 8,034</h2>

<p>Well, Martha, what do you,&#8211;eh?</p>

<h2 id="story8035">Story 8,035</h2>

<p>Then I rode back for home.</p>

<h2 id="story8036">Story 8,036</h2>

<p>The home in the crowded city.</p>

<h2 id="story8037">Story 8,037</h2>

<p>All is best as they are.</p>

<h2 id="story8038">Story 8,038</h2>

<p>The letter was of great length.</p>

<h2 id="story8039">Story 8,039</h2>

<p>to run away from Sir Louis?</p>

<h2 id="story8040">Story 8,040</h2>

<p>See what gross inconsistency is tolerated.</p>

<h2 id="story8041">Story 8,041</h2>

<p>&#8220;How do you make that out?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8042">Story 8,042</h2>

<p>Sir Epicure, I shall leave you.</p>

<h2 id="story8043">Story 8,043</h2>

<p>Say I will love her everlastingly.</p>

<h2 id="story8044">Story 8,044</h2>

<p>And what are they doing here?</p>

<h2 id="story8045">Story 8,045</h2>

<p>She read the card with annoyance.</p>

<h2 id="story8046">Story 8,046</h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, try to remember it, George.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8047">Story 8,047</h2>

<p>Where do they get the money?</p>

<h2 id="story8048">Story 8,048</h2>

<p>We must maintain deterrent retaliatory power.</p>

<h2 id="story8049">Story 8,049</h2>

<p>Yes, like and yet not like.</p>

<h2 id="story8050">Story 8,050</h2>

<p>And so he made the cat.</p>

<h2 id="story8051">Story 8,051</h2>

<p>By what good chance, sweet Mosca?</p>

<h2 id="story8052">Story 8,052</h2>

<p>&#8220;So perhaps I shall rub on?&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8053">Story 8,053</h2>

<p>Where is she - my amiable lady?</p>

<h2 id="story8054">Story 8,054</h2>

<p>But that is now far away.</p>

<h2 id="story8055">Story 8,055</h2>

<p>None of that, none of that.</p>

<h2 id="story8056">Story 8,056</h2>

<p>You gave me such a fright.</p>

<h2 id="story8057">Story 8,057</h2>

<p>You must have asked her questions.</p>

<h2 id="story8058">Story 8,058</h2>

<p>I really cannot LAUGH at it.</p>

<h2 id="story8059">Story 8,059</h2>

<p>we Still apply the onion poltice.</p>

<h2 id="story8060">Story 8,060</h2>

<p>Redstart, American, breeding in immature plumage.</p>

<h2 id="story8061">Story 8,061</h2>

<p>&#8217;Come, my lads, let us start.</p>

<h2 id="story8062">Story 8,062</h2>

<p>They seem to be very nice.</p>

<h2 id="story8063">Story 8,063</h2>

<p>of the Greeks: so in Kor.</p>

<h2 id="story8064">Story 8,064</h2>

<p>For youth and pleasure are vain.</p>

<h2 id="story8065">Story 8,065</h2>

<p>&#8217;At present, it certainly would be.</p>

<h2 id="story8066">Story 8,066</h2>

<p>Local originalities there make their appearance.</p>

<h2 id="story8067">Story 8,067</h2>

<p>Well, you rascal, what is it?</p>

<h2 id="story8068">Story 8,068</h2>

<p>The other corner was disproportionately obtuse.</p>

<h2 id="story8069">Story 8,069</h2>

<p>made I him king for this?</p>

<h2 id="story8070">Story 8,070</h2>

<p>How now, thou core of envy!</p>

<h2 id="story8071">Story 8,071</h2>

<p>&#8220;I was in the drawing-room.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8072">Story 8,072</h2>

<p>But where was this water from?</p>

<h2 id="story8073">Story 8,073</h2>

<p>It was growing lighter and lighter.</p>

<h2 id="story8074">Story 8,074</h2>

<p>My guardian now came every day.</p>

<h2 id="story8075">Story 8,075</h2>

<p>I was then nineteen years old.</p>

<h2 id="story8076">Story 8,076</h2>

<p>&#8220;Lay it on with science, then.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8077">Story 8,077</h2>

<p>&#8220;I should like it very much.&#8221;</p>

<h2 id="story8078">Story 8,078</h2>

<p>She is not dressed, you understand.</p>

<h2 id="story8079">Story 8,079</h2>

<p>But she had jumped up too.</p>

<h2 id="story8080">Story 8,080</h2>

<p>from the university of St Andrews.</p>

<h2 id="story8081">Story 8,081</h2>

<p>Did the person wish to smoke?</p>

<h2 id="story8082">Story 8,082</h2>

<p>Then trust you us so little?</p>

<h2 id="story8083">Story 8,083</h2>

<p>Beltham, I implore you, be merciful.</p>

<h2 id="story8084">Story 8,084</h2>

<p>Ech Arefyevna, we are all sinners.</p>

<h2 id="story8085">Story 8,085</h2>

<p>What can be detaining Tan Gama?</p>

<h2 id="story8086">Story 8,086</h2>

<p>I think that was reason enough.</p>

<h2 id="story8087">Story 8,087</h2>

<p>Here Lucy made a wry face.</p>

<h2 id="story8088">Story 8,088</h2>

<p>My answer was not in words.</p>

<h2 id="story8089">Story 8,089</h2>

<p>Come, wandering Aengus of the birds.</p>

<h2 id="story8090">Story 8,090</h2>

<p>said Miss Trevanion, turning to me.</p>

<h2 id="story8091">Story 8,091</h2>

<p>Are not these very simple truths?</p>

<h2 id="story8092">Story 8,092</h2>

<p>And she gave it to him.</p>

<h2 id="story8093">Story 8,093</h2>

<p>No, every one would do that.</p>

<h2 id="story8094">Story 8,094</h2>

<p>Then he disappeared among the tombstones.</p>

<h2 id="story8095">Story 8,095</h2>

<p>Dispeream si te mater amare potest.</p>

<h2 id="story8096">Story 8,096</h2>

<p>All living things are obeying things.</p>

<h2 id="story8097">Story 8,097</h2>

<p>At about midnight we reached Axminster.</p>

<h2 id="story8098">Story 8,098</h2>

<p>King: Oh, it has literary merit.</p>

<h2 id="story8099">Story 8,099</h2>

<p>I can feel myself going West.</p>

<h2 id="story8100">Story 8,100</h2>

<p>All my perceptions were purely sensual.</p>

<h2 id="story8101">Story 8,101</h2>

<p>Some retire because of contradictory language.</p>

<h2 id="story8102">Story 8,102</h2>

<p>Elands, sexual differences of colour in.</p>

<h2 id="story8103">Story 8,103</h2>

<p>O fond anxiety of mortal men.</p>

<h2 id="story8104">Story 8,104</h2>

<p>I hope he be in love.</p>

<h2 id="story8105">Story 8,105</h2>

<p>Where could it a come from?</p>

<h2 id="story8106">Story 8,106</h2>

<p>The Church of Rome stands alone.</p>

<h2 id="story8107">Story 8,107</h2>

<p>When shall we see you again?</p>

<h2 id="story8108">Story 8,108</h2>

<p>I thank you for the question.</p>

<h2 id="story8109">Story 8,109</h2>

<p>The names of all the Actors.</p>

<h2 id="story8110">Story 8,110</h2>

<p>Then the water tanks were destroyed.</p>

<h2 id="story8111">Story 8,111</h2>

<p>She sighed and shook her head.</p>

<h2 id="story8112">Story 8,112</h2>

<p>You must take Grimaud and Olivain.</p>

<h2 id="story8113">Story 8,113</h2>

<p>She rode well and looked well.</p>

<h2 id="story8114">Story 8,114</h2>

<p>Not a slave was left free.</p>

<h2 id="story8115">Story 8,115</h2>

<p>They undoubtedly say this, he replied.</p>

<h2 id="story8116">Story 8,116</h2>

<p>Who told you of this Stranger?</p>

<h2 id="story8117">Story 8,117</h2>

<p>Ideas produce the images of them.</p>

<h2 id="story8118">Story 8,118</h2>

<p>I think you would like it.</p>

<h2 id="story8119">Story 8,119</h2>

<p>Thou art indeed perfect in qualities.</p>

<h2 id="story8120">Story 8,120</h2>

<p>I was present at the marriage.</p>

<h2 id="story8121">Story 8,121</h2>

<p>Weak the suppliant and the supplicated!</p>

<h2 id="story8122">Story 8,122</h2>
