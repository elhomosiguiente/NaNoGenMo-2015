Imagine your network is down but you need that program.

Now imagine a tedious conversation of someone having to read out that listing over the phone.

And the connection isn't so good, so the second one keeps mishearing things so the first one has to repeat things.

If only there was a program to generate such a tedious conversation.

Well, now there is!
